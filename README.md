# Data mining KNN project 
## Purpose:
to categorize reviews using a K Nearest Neighbor search algorithm
## Implementation
Uses nlptk, sklearn, and scipy to preprocess, and stem documents, find normalized tfxidf weights to build a sparce matrix, and determine category based on KNN algorithm implemented using a K-D Tree 
## How to run
Run files in this order
* prepareFiles.py
* preprocessFile.py
* demensionReducer.py
* preprocessTest.py
* categorize
## Future ideas
* experiement with K values, and Dimension reduction values
* try cosine similarity for the K-D tree distance formula
* use panda numpy to more effeciently process weights
